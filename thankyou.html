<h1>Thank You</h1>

<p>
When I first started working here, everything was new — the role, the place, and life in the UK.
I was simply trying to find my feet and adapt.
</p>

<p>
I tend to be friendly and open by nature, and I tried to show that in small ways — offering help, being light-hearted, sometimes a bit silly, just to ease the day.
Over time, I realised that not everyone reads things the same way, and at times I felt misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
There were moments when I quietly doubted myself and wondered if I was doing things wrong.
As someone new, I kept going and tried to stay positive.
</p>

<p>
I still remember my first day meeting you. We introduced ourselves — you told me your name, and I was a little nervous and didn’t quite catch it properly.
</p>

<p>
Everything felt slightly unreal, but I noticed how open and genuine you were.
</p>

<p>
There was a calm kindness in your smile — nothing dramatic, just natural and warm.
It was a small moment, but it stayed with me.
</p>

<p>
During a challenging period, that simple kindness mattered.
</p>

<p>
It reminded me that I was in a place with good people, and that helped me settle and keep going.
</p>

<p>
I’ve always appreciated how patient and straightforward you are — the way you explain things clearly and treat people with respect.
It never feels forced, just genuinely considerate.
</p>

<p>
Little by little, I started to feel more at ease here and to build connections with others.
For the first time, it felt like this might be a place I can stay.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to say thank you — quietly, but sincerely.
I’m very grateful.
